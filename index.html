                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I was born and raised in Fort Myers, Florida. I grew up loving FSU college football and I went to the
                    same highschool as my grandmother, Fort Myers High School.
                    I grew up playing football and running track a majority of my childhood. My freshman year of high
                    school, I was the 8th
                    fastest in the nation for my age group in race I focused in, 400 m dash. I was on a path to be able
                    to go to FSU on a track scholarship,
                    that is until I dislocated my knee my junior year. It healed fine but I was noticelably slower
                    because of it. I decided attended FGCU for civil engineering and interned at a
                    civil engineering firm during my time there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few years I realized long term, that wasn't for me.
                    So I pursued a new venture where I started up
                    a software development company with a friend of mine (whom I met in college). My focus in the
                    company was project management,
                    customer relations, and marketing. I focused on finding us clients and being the direct line of
                    contact with them. As well, I would
                    test the websites and report feedback to the developers. My partner focused more on managing the
                    different devlopers and designers we worked
                    with. He was the one who focused on the actual coding while I just looked at the final prodcut and
                    test it from there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over a couple years, we built our portfolio up and worked with clients in multiple industries such
                    as education, flight, fitness, dating apps etc.
                    We even worked on a small project for Universal Studios to create the Facebook page for the M. Night
                    Shyamalan movie Glass. However once Covid hit,
                    that made communication with our development team difficult as most of them were located across the
                    pond. At that time, I figured it would be a good idea
                    start fresh and move up to Tallahassee since I wanted to move up there pretty much my whole
                    childhood.
                </p>

                <p>Since I moved up here, I mainly focused on working and building a little capital. I began working at
                    a steak/beef processing plant as a maintanence technician just across the Georgia
                    border. Over a short period of time, I got promoted to a production scheduler. The production
                    scheduler uses software like excel to track and analyze data sets to be able to determine
                    what raw materials to buy week to week; and what the plant needs to run day to day to be able to
                    cover the customer's orders. The customer in this case being Walmart.
                    If you are in the southeast region of the country, any steak that you see in a black tray, comes
                    from that facility. I got to a point where I was saving the company comfortably 6 figures
                    a week compared to person who was previously in that position. However it got to a point where I was
                    consistently working 60+ hours, 6-7 days a week with no light at the end of the tunnel.
                    So I resigned from my position with the idea in mind to transition back into software development.

                <h1>Why Software Development?</h1>
                <p>With having experience in the industry in general, I have always found an interest in software
                    devleopment. However, what really pulls me to it now more than ever
                    is the fact that I have decided on a long term path I want to take, and software development is a
                    stepping stone in that path. If I stick with this and take the time to
                    become genuinely proficient in it, then it is a skill set I can always fall back on. As well, I have
                    noticed over time that once I have hit a point where I can't learn anymore
                    about a position, I get bored with it. With software development being an ever evolving industry
                    there is always something new to learn. In the long run, I feel that
                    the broad wealth of knowledge that both is and isn't yet established will never leave me with that
                    feeling again.
